Student Management System
A simple Student Management System made using Python.  
This project is a basic console-based program that helps manage student details, marks, grades, and academic reports.
About the Project
I made this project to practice Python concepts like:
Functions
Dictionaries
Loops and conditions
Multiple Python modules
File handling
Exception handling
Basic CRUD operations
The program works through a simple menu where the user can choose what they want to do.
Features
The program currently provides these options:
Create Student – Add a new student with their registration number, name and branch.
Read Student – View the details of an existing student.
Update Student – Change the student's name or branch.
Delete Student – Remove a student from the system.
Input Marks & Generate Grade – Enter marks and automatically calculate the grade.
Generate Academic Report – Display the marks and grades of students.
Save Data – Save student information to a file.
Exit – Save the data and close the program.
Project Structure
```text
Student-Management-System/
│
├── main.py
├── module1\_crud.py
├── module2\_academic.py
├── module3\_storage.py
└── student\_db.txt
```
What each file does
main.py  
Contains the main menu and controls the overall flow of the program.
module1_crud.py  
Handles basic student operations such as creating, reading, updating and deleting records.
module2_academic.py  
Handles marks, grade calculation and generating the academic report.
module3_storage.py  
Handles saving student data to a file and loading it again when the program starts.
student_db.txt  
Stores the student data so that it is not lost when the program is closed.
How to Run
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-link>
```
2. Open the project folder
```bash
cd Student-Management-System
```
3. Run the program
```bash
python main.py
```
The program will then show a menu like:
```text
--- Student Management System ---

1. Create Student
2. Read Student
3. Update Student
4. Delete Student
5. Input Marks \& Generate Grade
6. Generate Academic Report
7. Save Data
8. Exit

Enter your choice (1-8):
```
Example
For example, while creating a student, the program asks:
```text
Enter Registration No: 101
Enter Name: Rahul
Enter Branch: CSE
```
After entering marks, the program calculates the grade automatically.
Grade System
The program uses the following grading system:
Marks	Grade
0–32	F
33–40	E
41–60	D
61–80	C
81–90	B
91–100	A
Concepts Used
Some of the main Python concepts used in this project are:
`if-elif-else`
`while` loop
Functions
Dictionaries
Modules
`try-except`
File reading and writing
User input
Basic CRUD operations
Future Improvements
There are a few things that can be added later:
A graphical user interface
SQLite/database support
Login system
Multiple subjects for each student
CGPA calculation
Search and sorting options
Exporting reports to PDF or Excel
Note
This is a student-level Python project made mainly for learning and understanding how different Python concepts can be combined into one application.
More features and improvements can be added as I learn more Python.
